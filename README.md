# MouseSelectTTS
Select a text with your mouse. Python script will turn it to Text-to-speech


20211125 1455.py is the only code that is nearly working and it needs some improvements.

Other python files are just tests for other text-to-speech packages or Mouse input packages. I am still trying to figure out which one works the best.
